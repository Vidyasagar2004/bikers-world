<p>Bikers World , promotors of Eddy‚Äôs Xtreme are pleased to welcome Billy Bolt and Brad Freeman as current World Champions to the all new style event. After a successful running it now finds a new home at Fat Cat Moto Parc where a completely new style and format event will start off the series.

    Fast Eddy‚Äôs own Paul Edmondson, has mixed it all up with extreme, super and traditional enduro all thrown into the mix. The idea is to give the spectators and riders something new, fresh and racy which will be very visible at the Fat Cat facility. There‚Äôs even a SX track thrown into the mix. The format will see the traditional AM and PM riders get two 1-hour events each with both sets of results used to determine the overall winners on the day. This format will certainly add a fresh feel to the already popular events that Fast Eddy Racing organise.
    
    Result PRO class:
    1. Billy Bolt
    2. Jamie McCanney
    3. Harry Edmondson

    <p>The unstoppable lightning Bolt, you can always tell who the motocrossers are because they've always got it wide open and they aren't getting anywhere, nice camera work, how you keep your equipment clean and working in that environment is no easy task.</p>
